    "- Gibt es systematische Unterschiede in der Höhe der Durchimpfungsraten zwischen verschiedenen Kinderimpfungen, und haben sich diese Unterschiede im Zeitverlauf vergrössert oder verkleinert?\n",
    "- Lässt sich ein Zusammenhang zwischen den Durchimpfungsraten und der Kindersterblichkeit erstellen?\n",
